JamDrop is a free and open source Javascript library built for DOM manipulation and basic server-side operations.

<h2><b>Model</b></h2>

JamDrop uses an ID selector model for DOM manipulation similar to that of jQuery's.
Below is an example of how to change the background of a div once clicked.

All server-side operations are done using a function based model.
